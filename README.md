# Hangman Game!
I made this in an afternoon after tutoring another fellow.

# Outline:
[X] Game randomly chooses word from list of words 
[X] List of words can be provided as filename
[X] Show the blank spaces for each missing letter of chosen word
[X] Player has 10 tries to guess word
[X] Player can input a word or character as a guess
[X] Game will show letters the player has already guessed (sorted order)
[X] Game will also show letters available to guess (sorted order)
[X] Game reveals each correct letter of the chosen word as the player guesses letters
[X] Each incorrect letter guess from the player removes a try from the counter (be careful with whole words!)
